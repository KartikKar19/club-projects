            <p>Cute cozy and gorgeous, this place can double as a perfect date spot and as an apt spot for celebrating a special occasion. 
                Their brownie as well as the chocolate shots are sure to cause you sugar rush but will keep you wanting more. Chocolate fondue as well as their savoury menu are something to explored as well.
                Kinds pricey but not really, chocolate room has probably one of the most aesthetic decors in restaurants around the campus.
                The funky, kinda nerdy but overall beautiful d√©cor is simply elegant and classy.</p>

            <h2><strong>Review:</strong> The place is great for hang out with friends. The concept is great and ambience is so good. The
                food is good and so is the staff. The price is fine too, the goodies are eye candy of the place. Overall a
                MUSTTRY place
