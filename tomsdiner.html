                    <h2><bold>Rating:</bold>3.9/5</h2>
                    <h2>Timing: 10:30 am to 10:30 pm</h2>
                    <h2>Address: Phase III St., Vaibhav Nagar, Katpadi - Vellore
                    </h2>
                    <h2>Cuisines - serves Italian, Chinese Fast food</h2>
                    <h2>Highlights: Seating available - US based diners ambience</h2>
                    <h2>Must haves: Blue Berry Cheese cake, Vodka Pasta, Red Sauce pasta.</h2>
                    <h2>Average Cost - Rs.600/- per couple</h2>
                    <p>Barring the few broken lights, everything from the décor to the immense variety of cuisine available truly sets apart this dining spot from the rest of the eateries not only near and around VIT but restaurants available in a considerable radius around the institute too. 
                        Kind of pricey, but considering the quality of the ingredients as well as the extent to which the authenticity of the dishes are preserved, the price points of this place are completely justified.
                        Personal favourite as well as one of the star sellers of this place is the Marsella or the white sauce pasta. Along with their burgers and the cheesecake, you can have a full belly and a full heart.
                        Their tagline “Never trust a skinny chef” truly embodies everything the place and it’s owners stand for.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Review:</strong> If you are a fan of Italian fare, Napolitana pizza is one of your best bets. The food here will make
                        you smile and sigh with contentment, whether it’s Red sauce pasta or delicious cheese cakes. It’s no
                        surprise that this Italian restaurant at Vellore attracts many foodies.</h2>
